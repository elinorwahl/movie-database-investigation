# Movie Database Investigation

This notebook documents an exploratory data wrangling effort I made using a CSV file made from data taken from The Movie 
Database. Unlike the more widely-known IMDb, which is owned by a subsidiary of Amazon.com as of 1998, TMDb remains user-operated and user-edited, and therefore its film data is free to access by anyone.

The information in the CSV file used for this project covers a range of films made from 1960 to 2015. My work consists of:

- Making initial observations of the data to determine what is missing, duplicated, and helpful or unhelpful to analysis;
- Cleaning the data, including adjustment of numbers that might wrongly skew analysis;
- Plotting and making observations on the frequency of film genres across the years;
- Plotting and making observations on the link between film budgets, revenue, and TMDb popularity score.

I hope you find it interesting and informative. Enjoy!
